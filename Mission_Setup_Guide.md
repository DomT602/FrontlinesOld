# Setting up your mission:

To setup your mission, follow these steps:

1. Rename the mission folder to desired map e.g Frontlines.Takistan
2. Find desired SQM in Maps folder and copy and paste overwriting previous SQM
3. Check for any changes specific to the map in the Config_Master_Map_Vars and change them in the mission
4. In the mission, enter config folder, delete all configs except Config_Master
5. Head into Blufor Configs, choose desired faction, copy and paste file (in file explorer) into the new missions folder and take the faction out e.g Config_Blufor_BAF becomes Config_Blufor
6. Repeat for Opfor, Civilian and Guerilla configs
7. Pack the mission as a PBO

# Setting up your server:

Your server will need to run a mod for the mission to function. This mod is included here and is AW_Server. You can either pack it yourself and add it to an existing mod/your .bat file for starting your server, or can use the mod uploaded on the steam workshop here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2745517474
